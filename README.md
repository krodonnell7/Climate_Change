This project explores the relationship between climate change and precipitation. My goal is to see if there is a link between increasing air temperatures and extreme precipitation events in Connecticut's 8 counties. 

This project explores the relationship between climate change and precipitation. My goal is to see if there is a link between increasing air temperatures and extreme precipitation events (like hurricanes and floods). Climate change is said to exacerbate extreme weather events, so I want to determine if that claim is corroborated through outliers in precipitation readings. To do this, I have compiled daily summary data from stations in each of the 8 counties in Connecticut from 1900 to 2021. The data contains the daily high, low, precipitation for the station, as well as identifying information such as the station name and location. I will explore 3 questions to arrive at my final conclusion:
1.	Have air temperatures increased in Connecticut from 1900 to 2020?
2.	Are days with very high or low levels of precipitation becoming more common?
3.	Is there a link between these two phenomenon?
